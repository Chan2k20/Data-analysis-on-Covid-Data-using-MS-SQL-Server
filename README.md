Project Title: Data Analysis on COVID-19 Data Using SQL

Description/Problem Statement:
Conducted comprehensive data analysis on COVID-19 datasets, namely CovidDeath and CovidVaccination, utilizing SQL. The analysis aimed to derive insights into the global pandemic situation, focusing on various aspects such as total cases, total deaths, percentage of infected population, and vaccination statistics across different locations and continents.

Skills Utilized:
- SQL
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Query Optimization
- Database Management

Solution:
- Utilized SQL Joins, Group By, Order By, Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Views to perform the analysis on CovidDeath and CovidVaccination datasets.
- Analyzed COVID-19 data by locations and continents to understand regional trends and patterns.
- Evaluated the relationship between total cases and total deaths to assess the severity of the pandemic in various regions.
- Calculated the percentage of infected population to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on different demographics.
- Examined vaccination statistics per location and continent to track the progress of vaccination campaigns and their effectiveness in combating the pandemic.
- Employed SQL techniques to efficiently process and analyze large datasets, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy in results.
- Utilized views to encapsulate complex queries and facilitate data analysis and visualization.

Key Insights Obtained:
- Regional and continental trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Severity of the pandemic in different geographic locations based on total cases and total deaths.
- Distribution of vaccination rates across various regions and continents.
- Identification of areas requiring targeted interventions and vaccination drives based on the percentage of infected population.
